# 24PointGameMetaSolver
Hi

  This a 24 point game solver based on c++ meta programing. It means the problem will be solved by compiler itself instead of the target binnary.
  
  Some c++11 features were used for convenience of coding. But it should be easy to convert the codes to c++03 version.
  
  The source codes can be at least compiled on VS Community 2015 and have passed dozens of test cases.
